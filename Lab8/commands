**Docker file no change, keep it as it is.


**q2,q3,Dockerfile must be in testfolder

1. Docker build C:/Users/ankit/testfolder

command : docker images => will list the docker images.. ( take the image id which is around 4.1 GB)

2. docker run -d -it --name=pyC -v C:/Users/ankit/testfolder:/myfolder a1da1aecedca => this is image ID( different for different users)

3. docker exec -it pyC /bin/bash

inside container 

4. apt-get install vim

** mapper.py, reducer.py, inputfiles etc must be present in testfolder( which is mounted to myfolder)
